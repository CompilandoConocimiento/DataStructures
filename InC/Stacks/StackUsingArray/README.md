# STACKS USINGS LINKED LISTS

Here you have to your disposal  this code that implements in C a Stack using as a base an Array,
So... here are some rules:

* Stack.h Is the name of all the Funtions that we are going to use to control a Stack and sadly the type of item of the stack

* Stack.c Is the file where I implement all the funtion that are the same not caring about what an item is, these are the same for every type of stack

* TheOtherFile.c Is where first I implement the funtions that need to know what an item is , these are different for every type of stack

So.. For you to excecute the code yoy have to do something like this:

```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
gcc CheckStackArray.c StackArray.c && clear && ./a.out
```

With all my love
