# QUEUE USINGS LINKED LISTS

Here you have to your disposal  this code that implements in C a Queue using as a base a Linked List,
So... here are some rules:

* Queue.h Is the name of all the Funtions that we are going to use to control a Queue and sadly the type of item of the Queue

* Queue.c Is the file where I implement all the funtion that are the same not caring about what an item is, these are the same for every type of Queue

* TheOtherFile.c Is where first I implement the funtions that need to know what an item is , these are different for every type of Queue

So.. For you to excecute the code yoy have to do something like this:

```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
gcc CheckQueue.c Queue.c && clear && ./a.out
```

With all my love
